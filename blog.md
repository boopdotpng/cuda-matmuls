# Increasingly fast matmuls in Cuda

  This post is an in depth overview on GPU architecture and how to write fast GPU code. Even though all the examples and profiling in this post are done on an Nvidia card (5070 ti), the concepts are applicable to any kind of GPU-like device (find a better way to say this). 
 
## Theoretical performance 

## Cpu matmul 

## GPU fundamentals 

## A very simple GPU matmul 

## Profiling with NCU

## A very easy performance boost

## Tiled/Shared memory matmul 

## What about Fp16?

## How is tinygrad so fast?
